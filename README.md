# Airport Information App

This is a simple Next.js app to lookup airport information.

It's subject to **DBL Code Challenge: NextJS**

All data comes from a JSON file; for this challenge we don't need to set up a database to keep it simple.




## Objective

The following imaginary mock up has come from the designer to be implemented:

We want a simple UI that allows users to find and display an airport.




## Getting Started

The app is designed to work out of the box with no external dependencies, other than node modules.

```shell
yarn install
```



## Running locally

```shell
yarn dev
```

Once started, the app should be available via http://localhost:3000
